Instacart is an online store, operating through an app, already has very good sales, but they want to uncover more information about their sales patterns. The objective of this project is to perform initial data and exploratory analysis of some of their data in order to derive insights and suggests strategies for better segmentation based on the provided criteria.

The Instacart stakeholders are most interested in the variety of customers in their database along with their purchasing behaviors. They assume they can't target everyone using the same methods, and they are considering a targeted marketing strategy. They want to target different customers with applicable marketing campaigns to see whether they have an effect on the sale of their products.
